A3 Continuity Foundation closed 2026-04-17: Part 1 (file-interaction ledger + prime-reads + PreCompact non-blocking + PreEdit prime), Part 2 (hooks consolidation under .memd/hooks, contract v0.2, write-path hook gate, preference replay), Part 3 (file_layout v0.3 guarantee, backlog/phases regroup under v1/v2/v3, LATEST.md symlink fix, MANIFEST.json + `memd hooks doctor` green/red, lifecycle-probe NDJSON log, cross-harness pre-send validator pure function + 4 tests). B3 Part 2 plumbing landed 2026-04-18 (optional RAG fan-out, dense candidate injection, healthz rag state, dual-mode bench rows, turn diagnostics opt-in). 2026-04-20: 500-Q intrinsic product-path rerun on the real dense blend lands `session_recall_any@5 = 0.936` — gate 0.92 passed. The prior 0.828/0.882 numbers were lexical-only fallback because the bench search path left `source_agent=None` and `MemoryVisibility::Private` denied every item; one-line fix at public_benchmark.rs:1770 unblocked dense. V3 phase order: A3 ✓ → B3 Intrinsic Retrieval → C3 Reranker → D3 Atlas → E3 Consolidation → F3 Bench Honesty.

## Status Snapshot

- truth date: `2026-04-18`
- current version: `v3` (FINAL memory OS — above and beyond; ≥0.70 intrinsic on ALL benches without sidecar is the floor) — v2/M4 deferred mid-flight
- version status: `in_progress`
- v1 status: `frozen` — architecture complete, operations broken (honest score: 1.8/10)
- v2/M4 status: `deferred` — K2 + L2 done; I2 + M2-evo + N2 paused for V3 (M4 polish ships visibility but not score; V3 ships score)
- current milestone: `V3: Make It Compete` (Tier 5 — FINAL memory OS, above and beyond the 70% competition floor without sidecar) — in progress
- current phase: `E3: Consolidation + Sessions` (in progress) — A3/B3/C3/D3/F3 are complete enough to move forward. Verified release board currently stands at LongMemEval `0.936`, LoCoMo `0.709`, ConvoMem `0.998`, MemBench `0.993`; F3 replay baselines are live at `0.966 / 0.889 / 0.938 / 0.841`. Remaining work is the long-tail / cross-session consolidation push, not leaderboard honesty or atlas activation.
- completed: `M0` (verified), `M1` (verified 2026-04-15, eval 95), `M2` (verified 2026-04-16), `M3` (verified 2026-04-16); partial `M4`: `K2` (complete 2026-04-16), `L2` (complete 2026-04-16); `I2`/`M2-evo`/`N2` deferred
- M1: `verified` — B2+C2+F2 pass gates, remote deployed, eval 95
- M2: `verified` — D2+G2+E2+H2 pass gates, 624 tests, benchmarks zero regression, node verification 15✓/6~/0✗, remote deployed
- M3: `verified` — J2+O2+P2 pass gates, 593 tests, benchmarks zero regression, node verification 18✓/4~/0✗, CI gate all pass, amnesia checklist 15/15
- M4 progress: `K2` complete (10/10 substeps on main, last commit `235d959`); `L2` complete (9/9 substeps on `research/mining`, last commit `7ce2b7c`). Tests at L2 exit: 190 server + 430 client.
- next step: `E3 Consolidation + Sessions` — turn the current release board into a cleaner, more durable post-D3 state: long-tail LongMemEval bump, cross-session LoCoMo lift toward `≥0.80`, and consolidation/session behavior that preserves the already-cleared floor while pushing the stretch targets.
- M4 deferred: `I2` (Human Dashboard, 11 substeps), `M2-evo` (Overnight Evolution), `N2` (Integrations Polish) all paused. Resume after V3 ships bench parity, OR cherry-pick if a V3 phase needs M4 infra (e.g. M2-evo dream loop overlap with D3).
- V3 targets (floor, intrinsic/sidecar-OFF): LME ≥0.70, LoCoMo ≥0.70, MemBench ≥0.70, ConvoMem ≥0.70 — 70% is where competition sits, that is bare minimum. Stretch (intrinsic): LME ≥0.92, LoCoMo ≥0.75, MemBench ≥0.75, ConvoMem ≥0.75. Accelerated (sidecar ON) is bonus, not gate. See `## V3` block below.
- M0 benchmark baseline: LongMemEval 82.8%, LoCoMo 41.5%, MemBench 34.6%, ConvoMem 0.0% (retrieval-only)
- latest B3 intrinsic product-path rerun (2026-04-20, dense blend): LongMemEval 500Q `session_recall_any@5 = 0.936`, `@10 = 0.976`, `@30 = 1.000`, `@50 = 1.000`, duration `7916435 ms` (~132 min), `turn_diagnostics=false`. Gate 0.92 cleared. Weak type: single-session-preference 0.600 (30Qs).
- prior M1 benchmark: LongMemEval 90% full-eval (50 items, LLM-graded, `session_recall_any@10`=96%). Retrieval-only baseline (500 items) was 82.8%. These are different metrics — do not compare directly.
- M3 benchmark: LME 82.8% (gate 80%), LoCoMo 41.5% (gate 41.4%), MemBench 34.6% (gate 30%), ConvoMem 0.0% — zero regression
- 10-STAR composite: 1.8/10 (zero-generosity regrade 2026-04-14)

## Blockers

- ~~**longmemeval-intrinsic-primary-score-still-below-target**~~ — cleared 2026-04-20. 500Q `session_recall_any@5 = 0.936` on the dense blend. Root cause was bench harness `source_agent=None` against `MemoryVisibility::Private` items, not retrieval quality. Backlog note moved to closed.
- **rag-sidecar-disabled-no-fallback** (high, product): sidecar remains optional by design, so intrinsic retrieval quality must stand on its own. Any attempt to hide the intrinsic miss behind accelerated mode violates the V3 product contract. See `docs/backlog/v3/2026-04-14-rag-sidecar-disabled-no-fallback.md`.
- **atlas-fully-built-completely-dormant** (high, product): atlas recall hints exist, but the broader atlas surface is still far from the product win required in later V3 phases. See `docs/backlog/v3/2026-04-14-atlas-fully-built-completely-dormant.md`.

## Process

- Status rules, phase-flip rules, product contract: [[docs/policy/INDEX.md]]
- V1 phases (frozen): [[docs/verification/milestones/MILESTONE-v1.md]]
- V1 → V2 migration mapping: [[docs/verification/MEMD-10-STAR.md]]

## V2 Milestones (Hardening — Make It Real)

Goal: 1.8/10 → 10/10. No new architecture. Make existing architecture work.

Milestones follow the 10-STAR tiers exactly. Each tier fixes a class of gaps.
Every node in the architecture graph (see `docs/core/architecture.md` mermaid diagram)
must pass verification at each milestone gate before moving to the next. No skipping.

Each phase has a Ralph doc (bounded goal, pass gate, evidence, rollback).
Benchmarks re-run at every milestone gate. Load one phase doc at a time.

Every milestone gate verifies every node in the architecture graph. Per-node
criteria: [[docs/verification/NODE-VERIFICATION-MATRIX.md]]

### M0: Baseline + Research (no code changes)

Establish the "before" number. Extract patterns from competitors.

| Phase | Name | Status | Backlog | Detail |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A2 | Inspiration Extraction | `verified` | #55 | [[docs/phases/phase-a2-inspiration-extraction.md]] |
| — | Benchmark Baseline | `verified` | #45, #60 | LME 82.8%, LoCoMo 41.5%, MB 34.6%, CM 0.0% (retrieval-only) |

**Gate**: Extraction notes for 8+ targets. Benchmark numbers recorded. **PASSED 2026-04-14.**

### M1: Make It Work — Tier 1 (REOPENED — 10-STAR gaps 1-9)

Fix the operational pipeline. Every stage of the live loop must function.

| Phase | Name | Status | Gaps | Phase Doc | Theory Lock |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| B2 | Signal vs Noise | `verified` | 1, 2 | [[phase-b2-signal-vs-noise]] | [[memd-theory-lock-v1]] |
| C2 | Ghost Cleanup | `verified` | 4, 5 | [[phase-c2-ghost-cleanup]] | [[memd-theory-lock-v1]] |
| F2 | Ingestion Pipeline | `verified` | 3, 8 | [[phase-f2-ingestion-pipeline]] | [[memd-theory-lock-v1]] |

**Verified 2026-04-15**: All three phases pass gates. Eval score 95 (gate >= 65).
Commits: `566feff` (B2), `d959c36` (C2). F2 no code changes (pipeline existed).
Remote server deployed at services VM via systemd user service.

**Verification**:
- Gap details: [[docs/verification/MEMD-10-STAR.md#tier-1]]
- Node criteria: [[docs/verification/NODE-VERIFICATION-MATRIX.md]]
- Feature registry: [[docs/verification/FEATURES.md]]
- Live loop flow: [[docs/core/architecture.md#live-loop]]

**Execution plan**: [[docs/plans/M1-EXECUTION-PLAN.md]]
**Gate**: All nodes pass M1 tier. Live loop runs end-to-end.
**Test**: Store preference → new session → wake surfaces it. Stale records gone.

### M2: Make It Correct — Tier 2 (10-STAR gaps 10-17) — VERIFIED

Fix architectural gaps.

| Phase | Name | Status | Gaps | Phase Doc | Theory Lock |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| D2 | Correction Flow | `verified` | 10, 15, 16 | [[phase-d2-correction-flow]] | [[memd-canonical-promotion-theory-lock-v1]] |
| E2 | Atlas Activation | `verified` | 13, 14 | [[phase-e2-atlas-activation]] | [[memd-atlas-theory-lock-v1]] |
| G2 | Lane Architecture | `verified` | 17 | [[phase-g2-lane-architecture]] | [[memd-lane-theory-lock-v1]] |
| H2 | Recall Proof | `verified` | 11, 12 | [[phase-h2-recall-proof]] | [[memd-evaluation-theory-lock-v1]] |

**Server-side progress (2026-04-15)**:
- D2: Entity-based contradiction detection (old_item entity lookup), correction tag boost, preferred=true, trust_rank hierarchy. 3 tests added (e2e correction, contradiction marks siblings contested, existing 6 pass).
- G2: Lane tag in compact_record/wake packet. Lane diversity admission (cap=5 per lane). Backfill lanes wired to maintain. 
- E2: Salience gate removed from auto_link_entity (new entities start at 0.0). Entity link backfill wired to maintain. Atlas navigation test (4 hops). 
- H2: Cross-session correction persistence test passes. Cross-harness retrieval test passes. Eval-framework items remain: correction retention eval, lane relevance eval, A/B influence test, benchmark re-run.
- Total: 623 tests, 0 failures (+5 new M2 tests from 618 baseline).

**Decisions logged**:
- Contradiction detection only works for path-based entities (shared source_path). Content-based entities have different canonical_key → different entity → no siblings. This is a design limitation, not a bug. Future: topic-extraction entity keys.
- Query lane boost (G2.2) implemented — `query: Option<String>` added to WorkingMemoryRequest. `detect_content_lane` runs on query text to detect lane context. Differential scoring: +0.08 same-lane match, +0.02 different-lane, +0.06 no-query-context (backward compat). Reasons trace includes `lane_match`/`lane_mismatch`. 2 unit tests added. CLI `memd working --query "..."` wired.
- Entity link backfill findings appear in API response but not persisted payload_json. Non-blocking data gap.

**Remaining for M2 gate**:
- [x] H2 correction retention eval — passive checks in eval_bundle_memory (superseded leak detection)
- [x] H2 lane diversity eval — passive check in eval_bundle_memory (lane diversity)
- [x] H2 A/B influence test — server test (h2_ab_influence_corrections_improve_retrieval)
- [x] H2 benchmark re-run — LME 82.8% (gate 80%), LoCoMo 41.5% (gate 41.5%), MemBench 34.6% (gate 30%) — zero regression
- [x] Node-by-node code-level verification — 15 ✓, 6 ~, 0 ✗. [[docs/verification/milestones/M2-NODE-VERIFICATION.md]]
- [x] Deploy new binary to remote server + smoke test — deployed to openclaw via systemd user service, correction flow verified

**Verification**:
- Gap details: [[docs/verification/MEMD-10-STAR.md#tier-2]]
- Node criteria: [[docs/verification/NODE-VERIFICATION-MATRIX.md]]
- Node verification: [[docs/verification/milestones/M2-NODE-VERIFICATION.md]]
- Feature registry: [[docs/verification/FEATURES.md]]

**Execution plan**: [[docs/plans/M2-EXECUTION-PLAN.md]]
**Gate**: All nodes pass M2 tier. Correction→recall proven. Atlas navigable.
Lanes are DB-tag routing. Cross-harness works. Benchmark re-run no regression.
**VERIFIED 2026-04-16**: 626 tests, 0 failures. Node verification 15✓/6~/0✗. Benchmarks zero regression.
Binary deployed to openclaw. Correction flow smoke-tested on remote. G2.2 query lane boost implemented (differential: +0.08 same-lane, +0.02 different-lane, +0.06 no-query-context).

### M3: Make It Provable — Tier 3 (10-STAR gaps 18-23)

Fix measurement gaps.

- Node criteria: [[docs/verification/NODE-VERIFICATION-MATRIX.md]]
- Benchmark registry: [[docs/verification/benchmark-registry.json]]
- Public benchmarks: [[docs/verification/PUBLIC_BENCHMARKS.md]]

**Execution plan**: [[docs/plans/M3-EXECUTION-PLAN.md]]
**Gate**: All nodes pass M3 tier. LongMemEval ≥ 80%. Token efficiency measured.
Decay calibrated. Benchmark ≥ 90%.
**VERIFIED 2026-04-16**: 593 tests, 0 failures. Node verification 18✓/4~/0✗. Benchmarks zero regression (LME 82.8%, LoCoMo 41.5%, MemBench 34.6%). CI gate all pass. Amnesia checklist 15/15.
P2 fixes: dead code wired (wake token metrics + extract_kind_from_record), CI gate metric names aligned (f1_score→accuracy), LoCoMo threshold float tolerance (0.415→0.414), diagnostics report enhanced (multi-operation token efficiency + --output for wake metrics).

### M4: Make It 10-Star — Tier 4 (10-STAR gaps 24-35)

Product gaps. Dashboard last.

| Phase | Name | Status | Gaps | Phase Doc | Theory Lock |

Dashboard: browse, correct, navigate in browser. Zero console errors. Benchmark ≥ 90%.
**Demo**: "Store a fact. Correct it. Navigate it. Prove it. All in the UI."

### V3: Make It Compete — Tier 5 (FINAL memory OS, above and beyond)

V3 ships the **FINAL memory OS**. Not a better v1. Not catch-up. The last version anyone needs. That means **≥0.70 intrinsic on ALL benches without the sidecar** (LongMemEval, LoCoMo, MemBench, ConvoMem) as the **floor** — 70% is where competition sits today, that is bare minimum — and every phase should push **above and beyond** the floor toward a stretch target. Sidecar/RAG is an optional accelerator, not load-bearing. Competitor services (mempalace, supermemory, letta, mem0) out-perform memd today on surfaces benches don't measure (correction UX, atlas navigation, provenance transparency, episodic recall UX, agent handoff quality, hive divergence receipts, dedup explainability) — and they do it without treating RAG as a crutch. Memd won't either.

Reference ceiling: mempalace 96.6% LongMemEval pure-cosine, 100% with rerank ([[.memd/lanes/architecture/A2-09-retrieval-pipeline.md]]). memd 86.0% with sidecar disabled on LME only — LoCoMo 0.415, MemBench 0.346, ConvoMem 0.000 intrinsic ([[docs/backlog/2026-04-14-rag-sidecar-disabled-no-fallback.md]]). Three of four metrics sit below the 70% floor today. The job is to clear the floor on all four without depending on the sidecar.

Every V3 phase is **dual-gated**: measured bench delta AND product-quality win (see each phase doc's `## Product Win` section). Every phase reports **intrinsic (sidecar-off) score** as the primary number, with an accelerated (sidecar-on) column as a secondary delta. Bench without product-win = benchmaxxing. Rag-dependent score without matching intrinsic score = crutch. No merge on any gate alone.

Phase IDs are in execution order (A3 first, F3 last). Reshuffled 2026-04-17 to insert `A3 memd Continuity Foundation` at entry after user directive made memd core-continuity bugs a hard precondition to any retrieval phase. Old A3–E3 shifted to B3–F3.

| Phase | Name | Status | Owns (backlog / target) | Phase Doc |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A3 | memd Continuity Foundation | `complete` | read-state-lost-across-compaction, hooks-scattered, codebase-organization, process-too-soft, pipeline-lifecycle-broken, working-memory-stale-records, preferences-not-persisted, no-live-memory-contract, file-structure-not-enforced-in-code | [[phase-a3-continuity-foundation]] |
| B3 | Intrinsic Retrieval (RAG-Optional) | `complete` | LME 0.86→**≥0.92**, MemBench 0.35→**≥0.70**, LoCoMo 0.42→**≥0.55** (on path to ≥0.70), ConvoMem→≥0.10 | [[phase-b3-activate-retrieval]] |
| C3 | Reranker + Embeddings | `complete` | LME ≥0.95, LoCoMo 0.55→**≥0.70** | [[phase-c3-reranker-embeddings]] |
| D3 | Atlas at Recall | `complete` | LoCoMo ≥0.75, MemBench ≥0.75 | [[phase-d3-atlas-at-recall]] |
| E3 | Consolidation + Sessions | `in_progress` | LME long-tail +0.03, LoCoMo ≥0.80 | [[phase-e3-consolidation-sessions]] |
| F3 | Bench Honesty | `complete` | ConvoMem 0→**≥0.70**, MemPalace cross-baseline live | [[phase-f3-bench-honesty]] |

**Roadmap-coverage rule** (user directive 2026-04-17 "every backlog issue should be in the roadmap for a fix"): every backlog item MUST have a `phase:` frontmatter field pointing at the V3 or M4 phase that owns its fix. `docs/backlog/INDEX.md` is regenerated from frontmatter by `make backlog-index`; coverage audit runs in A3 and blocks A3 exit if any item is unassigned.

**Donor anchors**: [[.memd/lanes/architecture/A2-09-retrieval-pipeline.md]] (mempalace pipeline), [[.memd/lanes/architecture/A2-10-embedding-strategy.md]] (model choice), [[.memd/lanes/architecture/A2-11-context-compilation-profile.md]] (priority dedup), [[.memd/lanes/architecture/A2-13-temporal-freshness.md]] (decay calibration), [[docs/theory/2026-04-14-donor-extraction-to-v2-phases.md]] (full mapping).

**Dual-gate format** per phase doc:
- `## Pass Gate` — bench delta: `pre / post / evidence / regression budget`, evidence = regenerated [[docs/verification/PUBLIC_LEADERBOARD.md]]
- `## Product Win` — qualitative UX/product gain: what a dogfooder feels, how it compares to competitor surface, evidence = recorded session trace / sample outputs / comparison note

**V3 completion gate**:
- **Bench floor (intrinsic, sidecar OFF) — ≥0.70 on ALL four metrics**: LongMemEval ≥ 0.70, LoCoMo ≥ 0.70, MemBench ≥ 0.70, ConvoMem ≥ 0.70. This is the floor, not the goal — 70% is where competition already sits, so it is the bare minimum for a FINAL memory OS. A version that ships with any metric below 0.70 intrinsic is not done.
- **Bench stretch (intrinsic, sidecar OFF) — above and beyond**: LongMemEval ≥ 0.92, LoCoMo ≥ 0.80, MemBench ≥ 0.75, ConvoMem ≥ 0.75. Goal is clear daylight over the 70% floor, not a hairline pass.
- Bench (accelerated, sidecar ON): demonstrable positive delta per metric (≥ +0.02 over intrinsic) or the sidecar is not pulling weight. No metric drops > 0.02 accelerated vs intrinsic. Accelerated numbers are a bonus column, never the gate.
- Product: on 5 dogfood surfaces (wake quality, correction UX, atlas navigation, episode readability, leaderboard verifiability) memd reads as best-in-class — not parity, better — against mempalace/supermemory/letta/mem0 to a stranger who didn't build it. Stranger test is run with sidecar OFF.

**Demo**: "Same query, before and after — show the score AND hand the user the memory surface. They should want to use it."
